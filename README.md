# NBA Game Prediction & Analytics

A comprehensive sports analytics project that demonstrates data collection, feature engineering, machine learning, and visualization skills applied to NBA game prediction.

## 🏀 Project Overview

This project builds a predictive model for NBA game outcomes using historical game data. It showcases:

- **Data Engineering**: API integration and data pipeline development
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful predictive features from raw game data
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest classifier for game outcome prediction
- **Data Visualization**: Professional analytics dashboards
- **Business Value**: Real-world application of data science to sports analytics

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches historical NBA game data from public API
- Collects team information and game statistics
- Handles pagination and error handling

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Calculates rolling averages for team performance (last 5 games)
- Creates composite metrics:
  - Average points scored (last 5 games)
  - Average points allowed (last 5 games)  
  - Win rate (last 5 games)
- Generates home/visitor differentials

### 3. Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 6 engineered features based on recent team performance
- **Target**: Binary classification (home team win/loss)
- **Performance**: ~65-70% accuracy (beats baseline 50%)

### 4. Visualizations
- Home vs Visitor win rate distribution
- Point distribution analysis
- Win rate by team strength correlation
- Feature importance rankings

## ⚠️ API Key Required (2024 Update)

The NBA API now requires a **free API key**. Two options:

### Option 1: Get Free API Key (for real data)
1. Sign up at https://app.balldontlie.io/signup
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Set it in your environment:
   ```bash
   export NBA_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```
4. Run any script - they'll use real NBA data

See **[API_SETUP.md](API_SETUP.md)** for detailed instructions and alternatives.

### Option 2: Use Demo Mode (no API needed)
```bash
python3 demo.py  # Works immediately, uses sample data
```

## 🎯 Predict Any Matchup

**Requires API key** - Use the **Matchup Predictor** to predict outcomes for any NBA game:

```bash
# Set your API key first
export NBA_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Interactive mode - choose any teams
python3 predict_matchup.py

# Direct prediction
python3 predict_matchup.py "Lakers" "Warriors"
python3 predict_matchup.py "Celtics" "Heat"
```

Features:
- 📅 Uses **2024 season** data (most recent available)
- 🏀 Predict **any team matchup**
- 📊 Real team statistics from last 5 games
- 🎲 Win probability for both teams
- 💡 Confidence levels (High/Medium/Toss-up)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/krakenking12/nba-analytics-project.git
cd nba-analytics-project

# Quick demo (uses sample data - fast!)
./quickstart.sh

# Or predict any matchup (uses real NBA data)
python3 predict_matchup.py

# Or run full analysis
python3 nba_analytics.py
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (3.13 supported!)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- requests

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: ~68%
- **Testing Accuracy**: ~65%
- **Key Finding**: Home court advantage is significant (~55% home win rate)
- **Most Important Feature**: Recent win rate (last 5 games)

### Business Insights

1. **Home Court Advantage**: Home teams win ~55% of games
2. **Recent Performance Matters**: Last 5 games' win rate is the strongest predictor
3. **Offensive vs Defensive**: Teams that score more consistently have higher win rates
4. **Point Differentials**: Average point differential is ~8 points per game

## 🎯 Use Cases

This project demonstrates skills relevant to:

- **Sports Analytics**: Team performance analysis and game prediction
- **Marketing Analytics**: Similar methodology for customer behavior prediction
- **Operations Analytics**: Resource allocation based on historical patterns
- **Business Intelligence**: Dashboard creation and insight generation

## 🧠 Methodology

### Data Pipeline

1. **Extract**: Fetch data from NBA stats API
2. **Transform**: Clean, normalize, and engineer features
3. **Load**: Store in pandas DataFrames for analysis
4. **Model**: Train Random Forest classifier
5. **Evaluate**: Test on holdout set
6. **Visualize**: Generate insights dashboard

### Feature Engineering Approach

For each team in each game, calculate:
- **Offensive Power**: Average points scored in last 5 games
- **Defensive Power**: Average points allowed in last 5 games
- **Momentum**: Win rate in last 5 games

These features capture:
- Recent form (recency bias)
- Offensive/defensive balance
- Team consistency

### Model Selection

**Why Random Forest?**
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Resistant to overfitting
- Provides feature importance
- Good performance on tabular data
- Interpretable results
